"""Test the GUI counter (apps/gui/counter_demo.py + count.su).

Emma's recurrent-loop demo: each click increments an integer ON THE SUBSTRATE
(count.su's step(n) = n + 1), and the displayed glow's centre is positioned FROM
the count on the substrate (pixel(x, y, n)), so it steps left -> right as you
count. This guards both substrate computations. No window/click is exercised
(headless-safe); the live click is verified by hand via `python
apps/gui/counter_demo.py`. Torch-gated like the other real-Sutra tests.
