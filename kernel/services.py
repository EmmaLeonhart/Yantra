"""Service abstraction for the kernel.

A `Service` is what backs an admitted process. It has two lifecycle
hooks the kernel calls:

  - `bind(manifest, router)` — once at admission, so the service
    knows its name (for capability checks) and how to send axons.
  - `tick() -> int` — once per kernel tick, drains any inbound
    axons and pushes any outbound ones. Returns the count of
    inbound axons processed.

**The default service implementation in this kernel is `SutraService`
— a real Sutra-compiled `.su` program whose `on_axon(vector) -> vector`
function is invoked on every inbound axon, with the result emitted on
the configured output role.** The Python `PythonService` exists only
for tests and harness code that doesn't need real Sutra compute.

Compilation pattern follows
`external/Sutra/examples/multi_program_axon/_run.py`: lex → parse →
torch_translate → exec into a fresh module → call the exposed
function. The first call into a freshly-compiled service downloads
the embedding model on first use (handled by Sutra's runtime),
which can be slow on cold start; subsequent calls reuse the cached
embedding tables.

    The `.su` source must export a function whose name is given by

    `(vector) -> vector`. On each tick, the service drains its inbox
    and invokes `entry_point(payload)` once per inbound axon, then
    emits the returned vector on `output_role`.

    Inputs and outputs are torch tensors of shape `(axon_width,)` —
    the axon-shaped vectors Sutra programs operate on natively. The
    router carries them through as the `payload` field of `Axon`.

    **Lazy axon evaluation: the compiled module's `AXON_KEYS_BOUND`
    and `AXON_KEYS_READ` constants** (emitted by Sutra v0.3.3+'s
    static-analysis pass) drive the kernel router's lazy delivery:

      - On `bind()`, if the receiver's manifest has empty
        `axon_keys`, the service auto-populates it from the compiled
        module's `AXON_KEYS_READ` so the router can skip-deliver
        based on what the .su source actually reads — no need to
        hand-write `axon_keys` in the manifest TOML.
      - On `tick()` emission, the service tags outgoing axons with
        the compiled module's `AXON_KEYS_BOUND` so receivers'
        intersection check has data to work with.

    Compilation happens in `bind()`, not in `__init__()`, so the
    service can read the manifest's `axon_width` for the
    `runtime_dim` parameter. First compile of a fresh `.su` source
    downloads the embedding model (Sutra's first-use side effect);
    subsequent compiles in the same process reuse the cache.
