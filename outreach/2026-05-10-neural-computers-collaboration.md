**Corresponding author:** Mingchen Zhuge (KAUST)
**Authorship pattern:** 2 × KAUST (Zhuge, Schmidhuber) + 17 × Meta

## Recipient list

### Confirmed addresses (sourced from public profiles)

| Author | Email | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Mingchen Zhuge (corresponding) | `mingchen.zhuge@kaust.edu.sa` *(primary, institutional)* or `mczhuge@gmail.com` | KAUST faculty profile + metauto.ai homepage |
| Jürgen Schmidhuber (senior) | `juergen@idsia.ch` *(long-standing public)* | people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ |
| Vikas Chandra (Senior Director, Meta Reality Labs) | `vchandra@meta.com` | v-chandra.github.io |
| Yuandong Tian | personal: `yuandong.tian@gmail.com` | yuandong-tian.com (note: he has reportedly moved on from Meta as of recent) |

### Not individually sourced — Meta authors

The remaining 15 authors all appear to be at Meta (Reality Labs /
FAIR). Meta's published employee email scheme is
`firstname.lastname@meta.com` (legacy `@fb.com` also routes); I have
NOT verified each address individually against a public profile and
have NOT included guessed emails in this draft — pattern-emailing 15
people on a cold outreach is noisy. The proper protocol is:

1. **Send to Zhuge as corresponding author** — that is the canonical
   channel and is what arxiv's `/show-email/` link is built for.
2. **CC Schmidhuber** as senior author on the same send.
3. **Optionally CC Chandra** as the Meta-side senior, since the
   collaboration question is partly a Meta-AI-resourcing question
   and Chandra is the right person on that side.
4. **Wait for Zhuge to respond** before reaching out to the wider
   author list. If Zhuge says "the right person on this is X," send
   to X. Otherwise don't carpet-bomb 15 inboxes.

## Subject

A programming language for the Completely Neural Computer — collaboration?

## Body

Dear Dr. Zhuge,

I read *Neural Computers* (arxiv 2604.06425) with real interest. The
framing of the Completely Neural Computer — stable execution, explicit
reprogramming, durable capability reuse on a learned runtime state — is
the same target I have been building toward from the language side,
and I would like to propose we work on the CNC together.

Concretely: I have been developing **Sutra**, a purely functional
programming language whose every operation compiles to substrate tensor
ops on a frozen-LLM semantic subspace. Source compiles to a self-
contained PyTorch program that runs on CPU or CUDA. There is no host-
side numpy on the runtime path, no scalar arithmetic inside an
operation, no libm calls; bundle, bind, unbind, similarity, projection,
rotation, snap, and loop bodies are all tensor expressions on the
embedding substrate. The compiler is the typing surface; the runtime
is uniformly geometric. Repo is at
<https://github.com/EmmaLeonhart/Sutra> and the website at
<https://sutralang.dev>.

The three properties your paper calls out as "remain challenging" —
routine reuse, controlled updates, and symbolic stability — map
directly onto what Sutra's design is built for:

- **Routine reuse** corresponds to function declarations on the
  substrate. Every Sutra function is a fused composition of tensor ops
  that is built once at compile time and applied at the call site; this
  is exactly the "durable capability" your CNC roadmap asks for, and
  it is reusable because it is *symbolic at the language layer* even
  though every step happens on the learned state.
- **Controlled updates** correspond to first-class semantic vs non-
  semantic binding. A learned-matrix bind is a meaningful update on the
  state (e.g. *located-in-country*); an arbitrary-matrix bind is a
  storage operation. The language distinguishes them syntactically, so
  what counts as "reprogramming" the machine is explicit.
- **Symbolic stability** is what Sutra's `is_true` /
  defuzzification machinery is for — sharpening a fuzzy substrate
  state along a target axis while keeping the output differentiable
  and substrate-valued. State stays geometric; the symbolic read is a
  projection, not a commit.

A working **TypeScript → Sutra transpiler** has shipped (14 fixtures,
end-to-end through to runnable Python), which means a real population
of existing programs can already be lowered to run on the substrate.
This is the surface that lets a CNC absorb the world's existing
software corpus instead of being trained on screen-rollout traces.
The video-model instantiation in your paper is one elegant way to
learn the I/O alignment; a transpiler-fed substrate is the
complementary path for the program-rollout side, and the two are
composable rather than competing.

The thing I would like to explore with your group is whether Sutra
could serve as the **substrate programming language for a CNC** — i.e.
the symbolic interface through which a learned runtime is given
durable, reusable, and audit-able routines, while the video-/screen-
rollout side of your work continues to handle the I/O alignment and
short-horizon control you have already shown is learnable. The two
research programmes meet at the same architecture from opposite ends.

A few concrete shapes a collaboration could take, in increasing order
of commitment:

1. A 30-minute call to compare notes on the CNC's symbolic-stability
   gap and where a substrate-tensor-op language fits.
2. A joint short paper / workshop note describing the two-sided
   architecture (Sutra programs on the symbolic side, your video-
   rollout model on the I/O side) with a small joint demo.
3. A deeper integration where Sutra's PyTorch backend becomes one of
   the runtime states that an NC can roll out from, with a shared
   benchmark for routine-reuse durability.

I would be glad to send a longer technical brief, a runnable demo,
or to set up a call at your convenience. Apologies for reaching out
through the arxiv email redirect — feel free to forward this to
whichever of the co-authors are the right readers.

Best,

## Notes for Emma before sending

- One concrete demo to attach or link if asked: the TS transpiler
  fixture suite (`sdk/sutra-from-ts/tests/fixtures/`) — 14 small TS
  programs that round-trip through Sutra to runnable Python. Easiest
  proof that the surface story above is not aspirational.
- Schmidhuber is famously protective of priority claims. Nothing in
  the draft asserts that Sutra anticipated *Neural Computers* — the
  framing is "your roadmap and my language target the same thing
  from opposite sides," which is true and avoids that landmine.
- The CNC term and the three "challenging" properties (routine
  reuse / controlled updates / symbolic stability) are pulled
  verbatim from the abstract; that's deliberate — it shows the
  email is responsive to their actual framing, not a generic pitch.
- If the response is curious-but-skeptical, the natural next send
  is a one-page technical brief that walks through one Sutra
  program end-to-end (source → compiled tensor ops → run on
  substrate → decoded output). The existing `examples/` directory
  has candidates.
