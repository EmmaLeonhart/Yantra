# Yantra

## Workflow Rules
- **Commit early and often.** Every meaningful change gets a commit with a clear message explaining *why*, not just what.
- **Do not enter planning-only modes.** All thinking must produce files and commits. If scope is unclear, create a `planning/` directory and write `.md` files there instead of using an internal planning mode.
- **Keep this file up to date.** As the project takes shape, record architectural decisions, conventions, and anything needed to work effectively in this repo.
- **Update README.md regularly.** It should always reflect the current state of the project for human readers.

## Testing
- **Write unit tests early.** As soon as there is testable logic, create a test file. Use `pytest` for Python projects or the appropriate test framework for the language in use.
- **Set up CI as soon as tests exist.** Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow that runs the test suite on push and pull request. Keep the workflow simple — install dependencies and run tests.
- **Keep tests passing.** Do not commit code that breaks existing tests. If a change requires updating tests, update them in the same commit.

## Project Description

Yantra is a neuro-symbolic, GPU-native operating system written in Sutra.
The OS is one big differentiable tensor-op graph: kernel, processes, IPC,
and GUI all live in the same tensor space. The CPU is a small orchestrator
that boots the system and shuffles inactive processes between GPU and RAM.

Target market is critical systems (defense, aerospace, industrial,
medical, autonomous) where predictable latency, formal verifiability, and
a small attack surface matter more than mass-market compatibility.

This repo currently holds **planning documents**, not an implementation.
The Sutra compiler/runtime and the JS/TS and C transpilers live in
adjacent projects.

## Architecture and Conventions

- All design notes live in [`planning/`](planning/README.md), numbered for
  reading order. Treat them as planning, not specification — they reflect
  current best thinking, not committed APIs.
- The chats the design grew out of are preserved as readable Markdown
  under [`chats/`](chats/). Re-extractable from saved HTML via
  `scripts/extract_chats.py`.
- New architectural decisions go into the relevant `planning/NN-*.md`
  file, with a one-line update in `planning/15-open-questions.md` if
  something there moved from open to resolved (or vice versa).
- Code does not live in this repo yet. When it does, expect the layout
  to be: `kernel/`, `runtime/`, `transpilers/`, `apps/`, `docs/`. Until
  then the structure is intentionally minimal.
