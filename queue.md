# Yantra — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** It lists what is being worked on right now. Finished work lives in `git log`; longer-horizon ideas live in `planning/` or `todo.md`. When an item is done, delete it — no checkmarks, no status indicators. If an item is still here, it is not done.

**Why this file exists:** when a planning step (formal planning mode or just "think before doing") produces a plan, that plan is written here BEFORE execution starts. An interrupted session can pick up from the queue rather than from chat context that may be gone.

This repo currently holds **planning documents and a v0.0 kernel nucleus**, not a full implementation, so most "work" here is design and small implementation pieces. The same rule applies: design plans go into queue.md before they get executed against `planning/*.md` or `kernel/`.

See `CLAUDE.md` § "Workflow Rules" for how this file, planning mode, and the task tool stay in sync. Longer-horizon items live in `todo.md`.

### Blocker (NARROWED 2026-05-17, not closed) — axon_project no-op across the connectome

The intra-module slice of the real fix shipped (Sutra v0.4.1,
cross-function producer-side pruning; submodule pinned). What
remains is **only** the cross-separately-compiled-program
(connectome) case — a single-module compiler structurally cannot
bridge producer/consumer wired at kernel admission. Not faked, not
forced; full reasoning + the remaining design options
(whole-connectome compilation / admission-time producer
specialization) in `planning/20-lazy-axon-evaluation.md` § "Status
(2026-05-17)" and `todo.md` § 1. Left here as a precise, narrowed
blocker for a future Sutra+kernel design session.
