"""Yantra font demo -- character cycler / pixel renderer (NOT an RNN).

Honest framing, corrected 2026-05-27 after Emma called the previous header
out: this is a *counter* with substrate function calls inside it, not a
recurrent neural network. Specifically:

  - The "hidden state" of this task is 2-dimensional at most: (input, current
    character-on-screen). One scalar in, one scalar out per tick.
  - The substrate's word width is 768-d (fixed by nomic-embed-text, the LLM
    backing the runtime). Every substrate value is therefore 768-d regardless
    of how much information it carries. For this 2-d-state task, 766 of those
    768 dims are dead weight; the substrate adds no semantic structure.
  - The pixels are 25 bits (5x5 black/white). Each cell is computed as one
    768-d substrate vector with the bit on the real axis. 767 dims of dead
    weight per pixel.
  - Across ticks, the host extracts the scalar char_code via vsa.real() and
    feeds it back next tick (apps/font/font_demo.py:tick()). That host-scalar-
    shuttle is what makes the loop a counter, not a recurrent network --
    state lives on the host, not on the substrate.

The substrate operations DO run on real PyTorch tensors. The cycle decision
(which char comes next) and the pixel decision (lit / unlit per cell) are
computed by real substrate ops. What this demo is NOT is "an RNN" or
"substrate-pure end-to-end" -- those framings would require state to live as
a substrate vector across ticks AND for the substrate's 768-d capacity to be
load-bearing on the task, neither of which is true here.

Substrate computations (apps/font/font.su):

  cycle_step(prev_code, typed_code, has_typed)
      Counter step. 36-way defuzzified select picks (prev -> next) in cycle
      order; override gate replaces with typed_code when has_typed=1.0.
      Decision is on the substrate; state is on the host (real() between ticks).

  step(prev_state, x, y, char_code)
      Per-cell substrate dispatch. ``prev*0 + glyph_pixel(...)`` is host-
      framed as "forget then add" but the * 0 is structurally a no-op (any
      input zeros it). The pixel decision is real substrate work.

  glyph_pixel(x, y, char_code)
      36-way outer select over char + 25-way inner select per char's bit
      pattern. ~22,500 substrate branches per keypress; documented as bloat
      in planning/26-font-bound-vector-rewrite.md (queued).

Usage:
    python apps/font/font_demo.py              # open window; auto-cycles, keys override
    python apps/font/font_demo.py --render A   # save A.png and exit (headless)
    python apps/font/font_demo.py --cell 40    # 5x5 glyph at 40px/cell = 200x200
    python apps/font/font_demo.py --fps 2      # cycle rate (default 2 fps)

    Uses ``runtime_dim=8`` (NOT 768). font.su contains no ``basis_vector``

    are pure math operations that don't touch the LLM codebook. So no
    embeddings are needed and the runtime dim can be tiny. Measured
    2026-05-27: at runtime_dim=8 the cycle_step / glyph_pixel results
    are still exact (codes 66.000000 for A->B, etc.; glyph patterns
    pixel-exact vs the font oracle).

    Why this matters: the previous runtime_dim=768 was 96x bigger than
    needed for this task. Every substrate op was doing 768-element
    tensor work to carry 1 scalar of information. Switching to 8
    eliminates the bulk of the per-tick slowness Emma asked about.
    ``llm_model`` is still required by the API but unused at runtime
    when no basis_vector calls are present.
